HOW TO USE

1. place aoe4_replay_launcher.exe in a folder of your choice, and run it once.
   -> if you move it somewhere else afterward, you'll have to run it again, so that its new path gets updated.
   -> configuration is fully automated, press Enter to exit the installation window.

2. go to https://aoe4replays.gg and click on the run button of a replay of your choice.
   -> your browser will ask permission for running the launcher.
   -> once you validate, the launcher will automatically download the replay file and start AOE4 in replay mode on that replay.

note 1 : make sure AOE4 is not already running beforehand.
note 2 : you should get an authentication error message in AOE4 at the start, this is normal in replay mode, just click OK and the repay will start.


LIMITATIONS

- only works for Steam users (no Game Pass support).
